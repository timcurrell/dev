    The purpose of the application is to help a fictitious company called Bill's Burgers
    to manage their process of making and selling hamburgers. Our application will help
    Bill to select types of burgers, some of the additional items (additions) to be
    added to the burgers -- with appropriate pricing.

    We want to create a base hamburger, but also two other types of hamburgers that are
    popular ones in Bill's store.

    The base hamburger should have the following items:

        - bread roll type
        - meat
        - additions (up to 4) that the customer can select

    The base burger has a base price. Each additional item gets an additional charge,
    so you need some way to track how many items got added and calculate the price for
    the base burger plus the additions.

    Create a hamburger class to deal with all of the above. The constructor should only
    include the roll type, the meat, and the price.

    Also create two additional burger classes to accommodate the following:

    1) Healthy burger
        - only brown rye bread roll is allowed
        - up to 6 additions (instead of 4) are permitted
    2) Deluxe burger
        - includes chips and a drink
        - no additions are allowed, burger comes loaded

    All classes should have a method that can be called anytime to show the base price
    of the hamburger plus all additions, each showing the addition name, the addition
    price, and the total cost of the hamburger.
