public class CollectionSummary {

    /*
    A collection (sometimes called a container) is an object that groups multiple
    elements into a single unit. Collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate,
    inspect, and transfer/receive aggregate data.

    The Container interface is the root of the collections framework.

    The Containers class (!!!) is the parent class for all container objects.

    There are four interfaces that implement Collection, and they all have slightly
    different attributes.

        Set -- a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.

        List -- a collection that can contain duplicate elements.

        Queue -- a collection with additional insert/extract/inspect operations;
                usually (but not exclusively) in FIFO order.

        Deque -- a collection with additional insert/extract/inspect operations;
                can be either FIFO or LIFO order.

    There is one more type of interface in this category, though it is not strictly
    a collection.

        Map -- an object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate
                keys, but can contain duplicate values. The ratio of keys to values
                is restricted to 1:1.

    The last two interfaces in the collection framework are sorted versions of
    Set and Map.

        SortedSet -- a Set that maintains its elements in ascending order.

        SortedMap -- a Map that maintains its key elements in ascending order.
