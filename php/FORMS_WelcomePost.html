            The POST method sends data using a mechanism that keeps 
            all of the data secure from prying eyes. There are no 
            limitations on the size of the data, and POST supports 
            advanced functionality such as multi-part binary 
            data transmission. Generally, and with rare exception,
            use POST to send form data.
