            The GET method sends data using a mechanism that is 
            visible to ANYONE WHO TRIES TO LOOK AT IT. Obviously
            this is not the preferred method to send any sensitive 
            or private information. The GET method also has a 
            limit of 2000 characters in terms of the payload.
