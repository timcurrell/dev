            PHP $_GET can also be used to collect form data after 
            submitting an HTML form with method="get".

            $_GET can also collect data sent in the URL.

            Assume we have an HTML page that contains a hyperlink 
            with parameters:
        -->

        <a href="test_get.php?subject=PHP&web=W3schools.com">Test $GET</a>

        <!--
            Notice that the URL referenced in the link is not to 
            an HTML page, but a PHP script. The script will parse 
            the contents of the URL that come after the '?', 
            identifying them as key-value pairs: the first one 
            is 'subject' and the second is 'web'.

            View the 'test_get.php' script to see how the values 
            are referenced by the script. 
        -->
