# Date/Time Formatting -- strptime() and strftime()

import time

# The strptime() function parses ('p') a string and converts it to
# a datetime object. This turns a naive date object into an aware
# date object that can be more readily manipulated.

myDateTime = time.strptime("20170406160000", "%Y%m%d%H%M%S")
print(myDateTime)


# The strftime() function formats ('f') a datetime object into
# a formatted string.

print("My 15th wedding anniversary was on " + time.strftime("%B %d, %Y.", myDateTime))
