# Python Identifiers

# Python identifiers must start with an alpha character
# or an underscore. They are case-sensitive. Numerals
# are allowed in the identifier, but no special chars

Tim = 1
tIm = 2
tiM = 3
_tim = 4
_TIM = 5
t_1_m = 6
print(Tim, tIm, tiM, _tim, _TIM, t_1_m)


# By convention, class names start with an uppercase
# letter, private variables start with an underscore,
# and (with rare exception) everything else starts
# with a lowercase letter.

# Python has the usual boat-load of reserved words, 
# look them up if you're wondering.
