# Whitespace and code indentation

# WHITESPACE IS NOT IGNORED IN PYTHON!
# Indentation is actually used by the compiler
# to determine which statements are grouped
# together. Errant spaces or incorrect indentation
# WILL RESULT IN COMPILER ERRORS!

i = 5
 print('Value is ', i) # Error! Notice a single space at the start of the line
print('I repeat, the value is ', i)
