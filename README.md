## README.md -- Tim Currell GitHub

### Introduction

This is the Git repository for my work studying various languages and platforms.

This represents files created as a result of working through tutorials on the web,
and serves as a reference for me going forward.

I can't imagine this material is of any use to anyone else but me, but if there's
something in here that strikes your fancy, by all means use it. I'm a rank amateur,
there is nothing earth-shattering hidden in here that is going to change the world.
